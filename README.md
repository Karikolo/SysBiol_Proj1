# UW-SysBiol-Project1
Geometric Fisher Model
Before running the scripts, start a virutal environment with installed libraries from requirements.txt
## main.py - for running the base simulation
`python3 main.py`
## heatmap_mr_ss.py - creation of a heatmap comparing mutation rate with selection
`python3 heatmap_mr_ss.py`
## mut_vs_env.py - creation of a bubble plot comparing the interaction between mutation rate and environmental values, measured by nr of surviving generations
`python3 mut_vs_env.py`
## boxplot_sexual_mut.py - boxplots showing frequency of sexual reproduction in populations with different mutation rates
`python3 boxplot_sequal_mut.py`
## sexrepr_vs_env.py - line plot comparing ratio of sexual reproduction to all reproduction in different environmental conditions
`python3 sexrepr_vs_env.py`
